Changing the value of parameter an in the one-dimensional Logistic equation $x_{n+1}=a(x_{n}-x_{n}^2)$ will change the value of $x_n$ after several iterations. The phenomena of period doubling bifurcation arises when the value of $a$ is fine-tuned; for the same value of $a$, fine-tuning the starting value $x_1$ of the sequence $x_{n}$, it can be discovered that when the value of $n$ grows, there will be apparent variations between the pictures of the oscillation $x_{n}$. The picture of the one-dimensional logistic equation and the Feigenbaum diagram with the stable oscillation value of $x$ fluctuating with $a$ will be reproduced in this article, and its properties will be analyzed; lastly, a quick introduction to the chaotic phenomena of the logistic model will be presented.

## Project 2

### abstract

Hodgkin and Huxley utilized Cole's voltage clamp technique to gather a huge quantity of experimental data on the electrophysiological activity of squid axons in 1952, and a four-dimensional nonlinear differential equation system was used to develop the mathematical model based on these data. This model can quantitatively explain the changing process of voltage and current on the neuron cell membrane and properly interpret experimental findings. The first section of this article uses the RK four-step method to calculate the changes in action potentials over time under various current stimulations by assigning values to the HH model parameters using four differential equations and the RK four-step method; the second section uses the RK four-step method to calculate the DC stimulation intensity and neuron firing. Finally, compute the total number of sodium ions that flow through the cell membrane per unit area during an action potential using the frequency relationship.

## Project 3

### abstract

The article discusses three distinct numerical techniques for solving eigenproblems, using the one-dimensional stationary Schrödinger equation as an example: ode45 method, Cowling algorithm, matrix method, and pseudo-diffusion method. The eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of one-dimensional flat-bottomed potential wells and one-dimensional quadratic potential wells are among those that are solved and shown in detail. Beginning with the solution of the stationary Schrödinger equation, the article analyzes and compares the advantages and disadvantages of the three methods, as well as the scope of their adaptation, in order to gain a more accurate understanding of which method is better for solving similar problems.
